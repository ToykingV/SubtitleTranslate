13
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,140
All right, team, stay in sight of each other.

15
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,180
Let's make NASA proud today.

17
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,300
How's it looking over there, Watney?

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,570
Well, you'll be happy to hear that in grid section 14-28,

19
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,530
the particles were predominantly coarse...

20
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,940
but in 29, they're much finer...

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,220
And they should be ideal for chem analysis.

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,850
Did everybody hear that?

23
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,080
Mark just discovered dirt.

24
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,670
Should we alert the media?

25
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,380
Sorry, what are you doing today, Martinez?

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,760
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
I'd like you to know that visual inspection of the equipment...

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
is imperative to mission success.

29
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,000
I also would like to report that the MAV is still upright.

30
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,110
Watney, you keep leaving your channel open,

31
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,260
which leads to Martinez responding...

32
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,570
which leads to all of us listening...

33
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,440
which leads to me being annoyed.

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,350
Roger that. Martinez, the captain would like you to please...

35
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,860
shut your smart mouth.

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,180
We'd prefer to use a different adjective to describe Martinez's mouth.

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,930
Did Beck just insult me?

38
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,110
"Dr. Beck." And yes.

39
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,820
Happy to turn the radios off from here, Commander.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,980
Just say the word.

41
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,880
Wait, Johanssen.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,740
Constant communication is the hallmark...

43
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,930
Shut 'em off.

44
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,070
No.

45
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,170
No. Excuse me.

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,590
I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel.

47
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,710
Accepted.

48
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,050
How many samples do we need, Commander?

49
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,020
Seven.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,370
100 grams each.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,890
We have a mission update.

53
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,910
A storm warning.

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,950
Commander, you should come inside.

55
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,130
You're gonna want to see this.

56
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,090
What is it?

57
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,300
A storm warning.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,830
I saw that in this morning's briefing.

59
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,510
We'll be inside before it hits.

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,490
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,590
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

62
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,000
Martinez, how does it look?

63
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,100
Not good.

64
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,270
"1,200 kilometers in diameter, bearing 24.41 degrees."

65
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,530
That's tracking right towards us.

66
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,760
"Based on current escalation,

67
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,840
"estimated force of 8,600 Newtons."

68
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,900
What's the abort force?

69
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,320
7,500.

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,780
Anything more than that and the MAV could tip.

71
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,250
Do we scrub?

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,130
Begin abort procedure.

73
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,570
We are estimating with a margin of error.

74
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,820
We could wait it out.

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,580
Let's wait it out.

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,670
Let's wait it out.

77
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,420
Commander?

78
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,350
Prep emergency departure.

79
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,190
Commander?

80
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,000
We're scrubbed. That's an order.

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,860
Martinez, how long before take-off?

82
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,450
12 minutes.

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,560
Visibility is almost zero.

86
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,200
Anyone gets lost, hone in on my suit's telemetry.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,950
- You ready? - Ready.

89
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,500
Commander, are you okay?

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm okay.

93
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,030
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

94
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,140
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,980
We might be able to keep the MAV from tipping.

96
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,130
How?

97
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,290
Use the cables from the comms mast as guy-lines...

98
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,060
anchor it with the rover's.

99
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,350
Watch out!

101
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,670
Watney!

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,910
Warning. Suit breach detected.

105
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,660
What happened?

106
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,440
He was hit.

107
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,050
Watney, report.

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,140
Before we lost telemetry,

109
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,660
his decompression alarm went off.

110
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,780
Johanssen, where did you last see him?

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,430
I don't know where he is.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
What are the vitals on his suit?

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,500
- He's offline. He's offline. - Negative.

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,140
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

116
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,280
- Beck! - Yeah.

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,760
How long can he survive decompression?

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,420
Less than a minute.

119
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,920
Line up, walk west.

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,080
He may be prone. We don't wanna step over him.

121
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,640
Commander...

122
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,690
- we're at 10.5 degrees. - Warning. Excessive tilt.

123
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,970
Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.

124
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,120
Copy that.

125
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,610
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.

126
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,600
It'll get you to airlock.

127
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,450
Get in, prep for launch.

128
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,810
What about you, Commander?

129
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,990
I'm gonna search a little longer. Get moving!

130
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,160
Go!

131
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,650
Watney!

132
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,750
Watney, report!

133
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,280
The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,110
One good gust and we're tipping.

135
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,850
If it tips, you launch.

136
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,330
You really think I'm gonna leave you behind?

137
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,070
That's an order, Martinez.

138
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,540
Mark!

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,120
Mark! Can you hear me?

140
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,650
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

141
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,930
Could that detect Watney's suit?

142
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,560
It's made to see the Hermes from orbit...

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,750
not a little piece of metal from a single suit.

144
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,210
- Give it a try. - Roger.

145
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,970
What is she thinking?

146
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,460
She knows the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

147
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,250
She's grasping for anything.

148
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,910
We've got negative contact on the proximity radar.

149
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,020
Nothing?

150
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,240
No. I can barely see the HAB.

151
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,680
Commander, I know you don't wanna hear this, but...

152
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,580
Mark is dead.

153
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,040
Commander!

154
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,100
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,820
My friend just died.

156
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,420
I don't want my commander to die, too.

157
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,080
Stability warning.

158
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,130
We're tipping!

159
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,860
Commander, you need to get back to the ship, now!

160
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,220
13 degrees.

161
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,360
If we pass balance, we'll never rock back.

162
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,420
I've got one more trick left,

163
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,330
and then I'm following orders, Commander.

164
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,760
You're firing the OMS?

165
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,210
That's right.

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,190
Commander!

167
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,660
On my way.

168
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,930
Johanssen, let's go.

169
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,120
Mark!

170
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,160
We're at 11.5 and holding.

171
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,080
Ready to go on your command.

172
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,420
Ready to launch.

173
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,400
Commander.

174
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,840
I need you to verbally tell me whether or not to.

175
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Launch.

176
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,520
At around 4:30 A.M. central standard time...

177
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,950
our satellites detected a storm

178
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,860
approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars.

179
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,200
6:45, the storm had escalated to severe...

180
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,440
and we had no choice but to abort the mission.

181
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,050
Thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis...

183
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,710
astronauts Beck, Johanssen,

184
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,430
Martinez and Vogel...

185
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
were all able to reach the Mars ascent vehicle...

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,580
and perform an emergency launch at 7:28 central time.

187
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,750
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...

188
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,470
astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed.

189
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,830
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team...

190
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,570
were able to intercept safely with the Hermes

191
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,830
and are now heading home.

192
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,690
But Mark Watney is dead.

193
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,930
Director Sanders!

194
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,700
Oxygen level critical.

195
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,310
Oxygen level critical.

196
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,550
Oxygen level...

197
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,490
Pressure stable.

200
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,170
Fuck.

201
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,900
Okay.

205
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,180
Okay.

206
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,860
Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.

207
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,660
I'm entering this log for the record...

210
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,130
In case I don't make it.

211
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,600
It is 06:53 on sol 19...

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,540
and I'm alive.

213
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,880
Obviously.

214
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,470
But I'm guessing that's gonna come as a surprise

215
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,190
to my crewmates and to NASA.

218
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,870
And to the entire world, really, so...

219
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,420
Surprise.

220
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,370
I did not die on sol 18.

221
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,030
Best I can figure...

222
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,990
this length of our primary communications antenna broke off...

223
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,290
and tore through my bio-monitor...

224
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,480
and ripped a hole in me as well.

225
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,660
But the antenna and the blood, really,

226
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
managed to seal the breach in my suit...

227
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,320
which kept me alive,

228
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,480
even though the crew must have thought I was dead.

229
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,230
I have no way to contact NASA.

230
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,220
And even if I could, it's gonna be four years...

231
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,700
until a manned mission can reach me.

232
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,990
And I'm in a HAB designed to last 31 days.

233
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,350
If the oxygenator breaks, I'm gonna suffocate.

234
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,950
If the water reclaimer breaks, I'll die of thirst.

235
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,440
If the HAB breaches, I'm just gonna, kind of...

236
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,520
implode.

237
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,130
And if by some miracle, none of that happens...

238
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,040
eventually I'm gonna run out of food.

239
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,970
So...

240
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,590
Yeah.

241
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah.

243
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,170
I'm not gonna die here.

246
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,920
32...
32...

247
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,580
33...

248
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,870
34, 35, 36.

249
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,450
Sweet and sour chicken.

252
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,140
What do we got?

254
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,430
Right, let's do the math.

255
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,070
Our surface mission here was supposed to last 31 sols.

256
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,380
For redundancy, they sent 68 sols worth of food.

257
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,640
That's for 6 people.

258
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,270
So for just me, that's gonna last 300 sols...

259
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,570
which I figure I can stretch to 400 if I ration.

260
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,510
So I got to figure out a way to grow three years' worth of food here.

261
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,310
On a planet where nothing grows.

262
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,530
Luckily...

264
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,830
I'm a botanist.

265
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,330
Mars will come to fear my botany powers.

272
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,710
Pressure stable.

274
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,810
Staple came out.

277
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,070
Fuck you, Mars.

280
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,430
Johanssen, Jesus.

282
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,940
The problem is water.

283
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,570
I have created 126 square meters of soil.

284
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,870
But every cubic meter of soil requires 40 liters of water

285
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,110
to be farmable.

286
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,380
So I gotta make a lot more water.

287
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,590
Good thing is, I know the recipe.

288
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,130
You take hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn.

289
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,210
Now, I have hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine at the MDV.

290
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,530
If I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst,

291
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,640
it'll separate into N2 and H2.

292
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,130
And then if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area...

293
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:22,930
and burn it.

294
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,940
Luckily, in the history of humanity...

295
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,700
nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire.

296
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,890
NASA hates fire.

297
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,900
Because of the whole "fire makes everybody die in space" thing.

298
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,280
So, everything they sent us up here with is flame-retardant...

299
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,960
with the notable exception of...

300
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,640
Martinez's personal items.

301
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,390
I am sorry, Martinez.

302
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,690
But if you didn't want me to go through your stuff...

303
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,810
you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet.

304
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,840
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be fine with this,

305
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,690
given my present situation.

306
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,980
Counting on you.

307
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,040
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

308
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,830
Best guess...

309
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,190
I forgot to account for

310
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,680
the excess oxygen that I've been exhaling when I did my calculations.

311
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,050
Because I'm stupid.

312
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,300
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...

313
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,810
Just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

314
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,870
Interesting side note,

315
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,250
this is actually how the Jet Propulsion Lab was founded.

316
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,520
Five guys at Caltech were trying to make rocket fuel...

317
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,770
and they nearly burned down their dorm.

318
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,410
And rather than expel them...

319
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,800
they banished them to a nearby farm,

320
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,420
told them to keep working.

321
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,190
And now we have a space program.

322
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,560
Okay.

328
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,160
Hey, there.

329
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,690
The nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program.

330
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,020
While his loss will be deeply felt...

331
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,580
The men and women of NASA will soldier forth...

332
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,570
Onward and upward in the mission of their agency.

334
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,700
By doing so, they honor the legacy Mark's leaving behind...

335
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,740
and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain.

338
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,280
I have the honor of speaking

339
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,650
not only for the men and women of NASA...

340
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,430
but for people all over the world...

341
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,490
I thought you gave a lovely speech, by the way.

342
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,190
I need you to authorize my satellite time.

343
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,510
It's not gonna happen.

344
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,010
We're funded for five Ares missions.

345
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,300
I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth.

346
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,650
- No. - Ares 3 evac'd after 18 sols.

347
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,770
There's half a mission worth of supplies up there.

348
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,530
I can sell it at a fraction of of the cost of a normal mission...

349
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,640
And all I have to know is what's left of our assets.

350
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,320
You're not the only one who needs satellite time.

351
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,740
We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up.

352
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,700
We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli crater.

353
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.

354
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,260
Surely we can spare a few hours...

355
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,160
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.

356
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,330
We're a public domain organization.

357
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,620
We need to be transparent on this.

358
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,220
Okay.

359
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,190
The second we point the satellites at the hab...

360
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,420
I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.

361
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,880
You're afraid of a PR problem?

362
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,550
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.

363
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,900
Another mission?

364
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,260
Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip...

365
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,120
If I put a dead astronaut on the front page

366
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,790
of the Washington post.

367
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,890
He's not going anywhere, Teddy. I mean, he's not...

368
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,700
He's not gonna decompose, you know.

369
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,900
He's gonna be up there forever.

370
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,050
Meteorology estimates that he'll be covered in sand...

371
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,100
From normal weather activity within a year.

372
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,730
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

373
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,600
Ares 5 won't even launch for five years.

374
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,090
We have plenty of time.

375
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,560
Okay.

376
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,770
Okay.

377
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,270
Okay, consider this.

378
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,970
Right now, the world's on our side.

379
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Sympathy for the Watney family.

380
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,890
Ares 6 could bring his body home.

381
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,370
Now, we don't say that's the purpose of the mission...

382
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,370
But we make it clear that that would be a part of it.

383
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,650
We frame it that way.

384
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,690
More support from congress. But not if we wait a year.

385
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

390
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,200
Vincent Kapoor?

391
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,420
{\an7}{\pos(165.49,127.604)}(46.7°, -22°)

392
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,390
6-2
6-2.

393
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,420
7-6-2
7-6-2.

394
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,220
Acidalia planitia.

399
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,560
What?

408
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,190
Hi. Security?

409
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,650
This is Mindy Park in Satcon.

410
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,260
I need the emergency contact for Vincent Kapoor.

411
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,120
Yes, him.

412
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,590
Yes, it's an emergency!

414
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
How sure?

415
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,600
100%
100%.

417
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,840
You've got to be shitting me.

418
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,880
Prove it to me.

419
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,280
For a start...

420
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,550
The solar panels have been cleaned.

421
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,770
They could have been cleaned by wind.

422
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,610
Back it up. Look at Rover 2.

423
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,140
According to the logs,

424
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,980
commander Lewis took it out on sol 17...

425
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,070
Plugged it into the hab to recharge.

426
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,480
It's been moved.

427
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,900
She could have forgotten to log the move.

428
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,110
No, not likely.

429
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,210
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

430
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,480
Let's get on capcom and ask her directly right now.

431
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,520
No. No. If watney is really alive,

432
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,290
we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.

433
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,530
How can you not tell them?

434
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,610
They have another 10 months on their trip home.

435
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,770
Space travel is dangerous.

436
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,520
They need to be alert and undistracted.

437
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,770
But they already think he's dead.

438
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,020
And they'd be devastated to find out

439
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,400
they left him there alive.

440
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,620
I'm sorry, but you have not thought this through I mean.

441
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,750
What are we gonna say? "Dear America...

442
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,410
Remember that astronaut we killed

443
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,090
And had a really nice funeral for?

444
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,400
Turns out he's alive and we left him on Mars. Our bad.

445
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,900
"Sincerely, NASA."

446
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you realize the shitstorm that is about to hit us?

447
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,190
How are we going to handle the public?

448
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,670
Legally, we have 24 hours to release these pictures.

449
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,740
We release a statement with them.

450
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,040
We don't want people working it out on their own.

451
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,710
Yes, sir.

452
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,130
But if my math is right, he's going to starve to death

453
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,810
long before we can help him.

454
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,470
Can you imagine what he's going through up there?

455
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,120
He's 50 million miles away from home.

456
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,220
He thinks he's totally alone.

457
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,810
He thinks we gave up on him.

458
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,950
What does that do to a man, psychologically?

459
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,550
What the hell is he thinking right now?

461
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,110
I'm definitely gonna die up here...

462
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,790
If I have to listen to any more god-awful disco music.

463
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,670
My god, commander Lewis,

464
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,110
couldn't you have packed anything from this century?

465
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,790
{\an9}♪Turn the beat around♪

466
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,040
No, I am not gonna "Turn the beat around."

467
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,380
I refuse to.

468
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,880
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

469
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,810
What attempts have been made

470
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,060
to make contact with Mark Watney?

471
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,150
We're working on it.

472
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,670
Does he have enough supplies to survive?

473
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,070
We'll be looking into that.

474
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,880
What does this say about the agency?

475
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,220
Are you gonna resign?

476
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,140
No.

477
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,390
Director Sanders!

479
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,360
It's time to start thinking long term.

480
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,280
The next NASA mission is Ares 4...

481
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,310
And it's supposed to land at Schiaparelli crater...

482
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,630
3200 kilometers away.

483
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,490
3,200 kilometers.

484
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,120
In four years, when the next Ares crew arrives,

485
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,410
I'll have to be there.

486
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,840
Which means I have to get to the crater.

487
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,090
Okay, so here's the rub.

488
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,910
I've got one working rover

489
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,940
designed to go a Max distance of 35 kilometers...

490
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,280
Before the battery has to be recharged at the hab.

491
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,160
That's problem A.

492
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,190
Problem B is this journey's gonna take me

493
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,830
roughly 50 days to complete.

494
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,640
So I gotta live for 50 days...

495
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,890
inside a rover with marginal life support

496
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,550
the size of a small Van.

497
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,290
So, in the face of overwhelming odds,

499
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm left with only one option.

500
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,450
I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.

503
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,700
Okay, so, success.

504
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,680
I have doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1.

505
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,670
But if I use the heater...

506
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,510
I will burn through half my battery every day.

507
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,970
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

508
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,080
slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics.

509
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,970
I would love to solve this problem right now

510
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,160
but unfortunately...

512
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,980
My balls are frozen.

513
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,320
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

515
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,460
Good news, I may have a solution

516
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,070
to my heating problem.

517
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,570
Bad news, it involves me digging up

518
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,320
the radioisotope thermoelectric generator.

519
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,850
Now, if I remember my training correctly,

520
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,580
one of the lessons was titled...

521
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,540
"Don't dig up the big box of plutonium, Mark."

522
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,010
I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,

523
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,290
but if they rupture around humans...

524
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,420
no more humans.

525
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,870
Which is why we buried it when we arrived.

526
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,000
And planted that flag...

527
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,490
So we would never be stupid enough

528
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,630
to accidentally go near it again.

529
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,090
But as long as I don't break it...

530
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,010
I almost just said

531
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,990
"Everything will be fine" out loud.

532
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,490
Look, the point is, I'm not cold anymore.

533
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,430
And sure, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm...

534
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,600
Because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding right behind me...

535
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,960
But right now, I got bigger problems on my hands.

537
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,410
I have scoured every single data file

538
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,060
on commander Lewis' personal drive.

539
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,250
This is officially the least disco song she owns.

540
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,110
♪Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'♪

548
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,680
- Yeah. - Where is Watney going?

549
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,050
We believe that he's preparing for a journey.

550
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,310
He's been conducting incremental tests...

551
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,660
Taking the Rover 2 out for longer

552
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,540
and longer trips each time.

553
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,950
To what end? Why would he leave the relative safety of the hab?

554
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,830
Well, we think that he plans to travel

555
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,810
to the Ares 4 launch site...

556
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,000
In order to make contact with us,

557
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,760
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

558
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,460
But if we could talk to him,

559
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,930
we would tell him to stay put...

560
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,530
And to trust that we are doing everything in our power

561
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,650
to bring him home alive.

562
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,700
Thank you very much.

563
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,960
Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.

564
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,340
You know what? These interviews aren't easy.

565
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,040
So god forbid I try to say something proactive and positive.

566
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,840
Annie.

567
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,120
No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

568
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,440
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

569
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,170
Are you asking me?

570
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,340
I am.

571
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,310
Yes, sir.

572
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,940
Mark drove two hours straightaway from the hab...

573
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,920
Did a short EVA and then drove for another two.

574
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,870
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

575
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,270
He didn't load up the oxygenator

576
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,760
or the water reclaimer?

577
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,050
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

578
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,800
It's just the way the orbits work...

579
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,360
So it's possible that we missed something.

580
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,450
I want that gap down to four minutes.

581
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,110
I'm giving you total authority

582
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,790
over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments.

583
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,810
Make it happen.

584
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,350
Okay.

585
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,000
Let's assume miss park didn't miss anything.

586
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,810
So mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet.

587
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,980
But he's smart enough to figure out

588
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,160
that's his only chance.

589
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,250
Bruce, what's the earliest we can get a pre-supply there?

590
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,030
With the positions of earth and Mars,

592
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,100
it'll take nine months.

593
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,940
It'll take six months to build it in the first place.

594
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,060
Three months.

595
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,580
Three?

596
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,740
You're going to say it's impossible

597
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,800
and then i'm gonna make a speech...

598
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,540
About the blinding capabilities of the JPL team...

599
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,920
And then you're going to do the math

600
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,380
in your head and say something like...

601
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,220
"The overtime alone will be a nightmare."

602
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,450
The overtime alone will be a nightmare.

603
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,300
Get started.

604
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,730
I'll find you the money.

606
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,830
We need to tell the crew.

607
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,060
Mitch, we've discussed this.

608
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,660
No, you discussed this.

609
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,780
I'm the one who decides what's best for the crew.

610
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,750
They deserve to know.

611
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,290
Once there's a real rescue plan, we'll tell them.

612
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,120
Otherwise, it's moot.

613
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,250
Bruce has three months to get the payload done.

614
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,140
That's all that matters right now.

615
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,870
We'll do our best.

616
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,100
Mark dies if you don't.

618
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,990
It's been 48 sols since I planted the potatoes.

620
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,270
So now it's time to reap and re-sow.

621
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,610
They grew even better than I expected.

622
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,170
I now have 400 healthy potato plants.

623
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,320
I dug them up, being careful to leave their plants alive.

624
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,190
The smaller ones I'll reseed,

625
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,560
the larger ones are my food supply.

626
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,090
All natural, organic, martian-grown potatoes.

627
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,990
You don't hear that every day, do you?

628
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,010
And by the way, none of this matters at all...

630
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,960
If I can't figure out a way to make contact with NASA.

633
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,150
I know what I'm gonna do.

634
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,250
Oh! He's moving again.

635
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,110
Where the hell is he going?

636
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,140
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.

637
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,940
He's nowhere near the Ares 4.

638
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,540
Unless he's not taking a direct route.

639
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,750
He might be trying to avoid some obstacle.

640
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,860
What obstacle?

641
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,550
It's Acidalia Planitia.

642
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,420
There's nothing out there except the...

643
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,040
What?

644
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,820
I need a map.

645
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:21,900
Yeah.

646
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,830
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

647
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,080
It's all right. It's all right.

648
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,270
Can I borrow this?

649
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,400
Okay, so where is the hab location?

650
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,160
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

651
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,400
Where's Watney? Uh...

652
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,550
There.

653
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,110
Okay.

654
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,330
Okay. I know where he's going.

655
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,850
I need to get on an airplane.

658
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,290
Vincent, how are you?

659
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,270
Good to see you.

660
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,740
- Good flight? - Uh... Yeah.

661
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,250
It's in storage just around the corner.

662
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,160
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.

663
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,230
Nice to see you.

664
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,620
What are the chances Mark can get it working again?

665
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,990
It's hard to say. We lost contact in '97.

666
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,680
We think it was battery failure.

667
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,450
Though I'd like to point out

668
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,610
it lasted three times longer than expected in any...

669
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,890
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

670
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,880
I just need to speak to everybody that was here in '97.

671
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,510
They're already here. Guys.

672
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,430
I'd like to introduce Vincent kapoor.

673
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,480
Director of Mars missions for NASA.

674
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,270
This is our current team...

675
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,300
And our original project members.

676
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,760
- Is this the replica? - This is her.

677
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,290
Okay. Let's see it.

678
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,800
Pathfinder.

679
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,740
Pathfinder.

682
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
Come on. Come on.

683
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,560
Holy shit. Okay.

684
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,450
"Broadcasting status.

685
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,490
"Listening for telemetry signal."

686
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,590
Okay. Signal acquired.

687
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,040
- All right. - Okay.

688
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,230
Camera.

689
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,600
Incoming.

690
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,950
"Are you receiving me?"

691
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,400
"Yes. No."

692
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,270
Okay, point the camera at "Yes."

693
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,910
32-minute round-trip communications time.

694
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:54,290
All he can do is ask yes or no questions...

695
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,240
And all we can do is point the camera.

696
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,040
This won't exactly be an Algonquin round table of snappy repartee.

697
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,950
- Are you kidding me? - Tim, Tim.

698
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,020
- Just point the camera. - Roger that.

699
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,450
Pointing the camera.

700
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,370
Yes!

701
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,980
Yes!

703
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,710
So here's the rub.

704
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,440
Somehow we have to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations...

705
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,960
using nothing but a still-frame camera...

706
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,690
from 1996.

707
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,000
Luckily...

708
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,840
the camera does spin.

709
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,100
So I can make an alphabet.

710
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,530
It can't be our alphabet.

711
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,990
26 characters plus a question card

712
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,550
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

713
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,920
That's way too narrow.

714
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,320
I'd never know what the camera was pointing at.

715
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,770
Hexadecimals.

717
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,780
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

718
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,820
I figured one of you guys

719
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,800
kept an ASCII table lying around.

720
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,010
And I was right.

721
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

722
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,960
I give you super-nerd

723
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,130
Beth Johanssen.

724
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,690
Who also had copies of Zork II...

726
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:36,970
and Leather Goddesses of Phobos on her personal laptop.

727
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,270
Seriously, Johanssen...

728
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,170
It's like the Smithsonian of loneliness on there.

729
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,140
Not that I'm complaining. Yes!

730
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,940
Who am I to talk about loneliness?

732
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,550
I know where he's going with this.

733
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,520
"F  O"
"F, O."

734
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,010
"7  W"
"7, W."

736
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,820
Vincent. Vincent, wake up.

738
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,570
Now that we can have more complicated conversations...

739
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,110
The smart people at NASA have sent me instructions

740
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,630
on how to hack the rover...

741
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,990
so that it can talk to Pathfinder.

742
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,690
If I hack a tiny bit of code...

743
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,810
just 20 instructions in the rover's operating system...

744
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,910
NASA can link the rover to Pathfinder's

745
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,820
broadcasting frequency...

746
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,510
and we're in business.

747
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,150
"Mark...

748
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,020
"This is Vincent Kapoor.

749
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,140
"We've been watching you

750
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,100
since sol 54.

751
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,650
"The whole world is rooting for you.

752
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,430
"Amazing job getting Pathfinder.

753
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,640
"We're working on rescue plans.

754
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,870
"Meantime, we're putting together a supply mission...

755
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,990
to keep you fed until Ares 4 arrives."

756
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,380
Okay.

757
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,200
"Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying."

758
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,120
"How's the crew?"

759
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,900
"What did they say when they found out I was alive?"

761
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,150
Guys, can we get some space please?

762
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,970
Me?

763
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,870
Yeah, you.

764
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,490
Give me a sec.

765
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,170
Just tell him.

766
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:12,200
"We haven't told the crew you are alive yet.

767
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,860
"We need them to concentrate on their mission."

768
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,420
Okay, he says, "They don't know I'm alive?

769
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,060
"What the..." F-word.

770
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,550
F-word in gerund form.

771
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,420
F-word, again, "What's wrong with you?"

772
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,480
"Mark, please watch your language.

773
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,350
"Everything you type

774
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:02,620
"Is being broadcast live all over the world."

775
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,130
Yeah?

776
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,890
Oh, my god.

777
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:18,900
Yes, sir.

778
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,170
He is under a tremendous amount of stress.

779
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,000
I understand. We're working on it.

780
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,780
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

781
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,340
Thank you, Mr. President.

782
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,740
Problem is, Mark's right.

783
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,770
The longer we wait, the worse it's gonna get.

784
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,720
We need to tell the crew.

785
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,150
You're bringing this up while Vincent is in Pasadena...

786
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,840
so he can't argue the other side.

787
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,750
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.

788
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,910
Or anyone else.

789
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,670
It's time, Teddy.

791
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,100
Commander Lewis?

792
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,570
Go ahead.

793
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,240
Data dump is almost complete.

794
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,840
Copy that. On my way.

795
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,360
You're in a hurry.

796
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,570
Yeah.

797
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,730
My son turned three yesterday.

798
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,700
Should be pictures of the party.

799
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,720
Got a batch of personals.

800
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:54,040
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

801
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,340
I don't need to read Vogel's weird German fetish emails.

802
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,790
They're telemetry updates.

803
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,670
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

804
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,950
There's a video message.

805
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,160
It's addressed to the whole crew.

806
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,380
Play it. Come on, guys.

807
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,410
I wanna get in on that telemetry action.

808
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,410
Hi, hello.

809
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,970
It's Mitch. Mitch Henderson.

810
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,870
I have some news.

811
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,760
There's no subtle way to put this.

812
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,370
Mark Watney is still alive.

813
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,680
Oh, my god.

814
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,700
I know that's a surprise and I know

815
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,460
you will have a lot of questions.

816
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,420
But here are the basics.

817
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,120
He's alive and he's healthy.

818
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,440
We found out two months ago

819
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,540
and decided not to tell you.

820
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,980
- Two months? - Oh, my god.

821
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,060
I was strongly against that decision.

822
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,550
We're telling you now because...

823
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:52,400
we finally have communication with him...

824
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,500
and a viable rescue plan.

825
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:57,570
We'll give you a write-up of what happened,

826
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,280
a full write-up of everything.

827
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,940
But it's not your fault.

828
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,650
Mark stresses that every time it comes up.

829
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,790
So... yeah...

830
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,490
Take some time to absorb this.

831
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:15,590
And send all the questions you want. We'll answer them.

832
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,850
All right. Henderson out.

833
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,720
Holy shit, he's alive.

834
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,030
I left him behind.

835
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,310
- No. - No.

836
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,510
We all left together.

837
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,730
You were following orders.

838
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,990
I left him behind.

840
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,620
So now that NASA can talk to me,

841
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,940
they won't shut up.

842
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,070
They want constant updates on every hab system...

843
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,410
And they got a room full of people

845
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:52,980
trying to micromanage my crops.

846
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,350
Which is awesome.

847
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,250
Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant or anything...

848
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:02,030
but I am the greatest botanist on this planet, so...

849
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,480
One big bonus

850
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,550
to this communication with NASA again... Is the email.

851
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,340
I'm getting them again.

852
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,030
Big data dumps like when I was on the Hermes.

853
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,760
I even got one from the President.

854
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,540
The coolest one, though, the coolest one I got...

855
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,020
was from University of Chicago,

857
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,460
my Alma Mater.

858
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,400
They say that once you grow crops somewhere...

859
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,540
You've officially colonized it.

861
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,380
So, technically...

862
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,090
I colonized Mars.

863
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,820
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

864
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:38,390
In other news, there's been a request...

865
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:43,150
or me to pose for a photograph on my next transmission.

866
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,360
I'm trying to figure out whether

867
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,640
I should go with "high school senior"...

868
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,350
or "coquettish ingenue."

869
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,330
But I'm not really sure

870
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,460
how that's gonna look with my spacesuit on.

871
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,660
What is he doing?

872
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:27,620
I asked for a photo,

873
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,230
and what, he's the fonz?

874
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,070
Just be grateful we got you something, Annie.

875
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,040
I can't use this, Vincent, and you know that.

876
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,690
I need a picture of his face.

877
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:35,980
I could tell him to take off his helmet...

878
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:36,960
But then he'd,

879
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,120
you know, die, so...

880
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:40,400
We'll release the photo

881
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,050
when we detail the rescue operation.

882
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,720
I want to announce we're launching

883
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,150
some supplies to him next year...

884
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:47,130
during the Hohmann transfer window.

885
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,410
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?

886
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,700
It'll be tight, but we'll make it.

887
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,840
Nine-month travel time.

888
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,970
That puts the probe to Mars on sol 868.

889
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,780
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

890
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,130
Yeah, they estimate Mark's crops

891
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,360
will last till sol 912.

892
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,170
They grudgingly admit that he's doing great work.

893
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,170
Grudgingly?

894
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,420
Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves...

895
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,560
whenever they question one of his decisions.

896
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,650
Get him in line, Vincent.

897
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,810
We can't afford any miscommunication.

898
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,150
I hate this margin.

899
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,120
912 sols worth of food.

900
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,000
We get there on 868.

901
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,800
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

907
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,800
Suit breach detected.

908
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:19,290
Oxygen level critical.

909
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,770
Oxygen level, 10%.

910
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,210
Oxygen level, 5%.

911
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,650
Suit pressure, stable.

914
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,930
Pressure stable.

915
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,820
God! God, god, god, god!

916
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:58,860
Crops are dead.

917
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,900
Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water.

918
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,510
Any bacteria that survived,

919
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:05,300
died in the subzero temperatures...

920
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,100
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

921
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,790
How long does he have?

922
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,810
He can still eat the potatoes he has,

923
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,910
he just can't grow any more...

924
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,040
So give him 200 sols.

925
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,240
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

926
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,120
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

927
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,800
So by sol 868, he'll be long dead.

928
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,150
We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible...

929
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,000
which changes our travel time.

930
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,320
Yeah, we're working on it.

931
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,970
Prelim estimates call for a 414-day trip.

932
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:40,400
It's sol 135 now.

933
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,550
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

934
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,700
perform inspections...

935
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,990
which gives Bruce and his team...

936
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,700
47 days to make this probe.

937
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,690
I'll let you call Bruce,

938
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,970
give him the news.

939
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:58,350
Okay.

940
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,120
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

941
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:13,910
"Dear Mark...

942
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:19,690
"Apparently NASA's letting us talk to you now.

943
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:24,590
And I drew the short straw.

944
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:32,340
Sorry we left you behind on Mars.

945
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,900
But we just don't like you.

946
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,120
Also, it's a lot roomier

947
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,410
on the Hermes without you.

948
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,210
We have to take turns doing your tasks.

949
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,370
But, I mean, it's only botany.

950
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:52,730
It's not real science.

951
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:54,080
Oh, Jesus.

952
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,390
"How's Mars?"

953
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,100
"Dear Martinez,

954
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,850
Mars is fine.

955
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:09,070
"I accidentally blew up the hab...

956
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,190
But unfortunately,

957
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,860
All of commander Lewis' disco music still survived.

958
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,720
But unfortunately,

959
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,760
All of commander Lewis' disco music still survived.

960
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,920
Every day, I go outside

961
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,640
and look at the vast horizons.

962
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,500
Every day, I go outside

963
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,640
and look at the vast horizons.

964
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,150
Just because I can.

965
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,300
Just because I can.

966
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:38,360
Tell the others I said hello.

967
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,140
Will do, buddy.

968
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,050
Pressure stable.

969
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,170
5, 10...

970
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:00,040
15, 20, 30, 35...

971
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,160
40.

972
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,160
52.

974
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,040
Rich.

975
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:36,570
Rich.

976
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,720
Wake up.

978
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,640
Sorry, but they're asking for the probe courses.

979
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,710
What time is it?

980
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,180
3:42
3:42.

981
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,120
Look, I know we're coming at this backwards...

982
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,840
But we can't commit to a firm launch date

983
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,330
with this many unknowns.

984
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,800
It's all right. Um...

985
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,310
All 25 models for launch

986
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,130
will take 414 days to reach Mars.

987
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,660
They vary slightly in thrust duration...

988
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:07,110
and the fuel requirement is nearly identical.

989
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,860
Not a good time to launch, is it?

990
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:13,110
Yeah, Earth and Mars are really badly positioned.

991
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,160
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

992
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:19,340
Almost easier to what?

993
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,690
I need more coffee.

994
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,080
Are you all right?

995
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:26,050
It's fine.

996
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,290
Almost easier to what?

997
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,860
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

998
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:52,420
All right, let's ask

999
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,810
the very, very expensive question.

1000
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,480
Is the probe going to be ready on time?

1001
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,530
- We're behind. - Give me a number.

1002
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:02,580
15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.

1003
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,290
All right, let's create 15 days.

1004
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,970
13 days to mount the probe.

1005
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,040
Can we reduce?

1006
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,830
It actually only takes three days to mount the probe.

1007
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:11,670
And we can get that down to two, right?

1008
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,080
I can get it down to two.

1009
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,110
10 days are for tests and inspections.

1010
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:17,750
How often do those inspections reveal a problem?

1011
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,660
Are you suggesting we don't do the inspections?

1012
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,140
Right now I'm asking how often they reveal a problem.

1013
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,270
One in 20.

1014
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,980
But that's grounds for countdown halt.

1015
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,110
We can't take that chance.

1016
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,820
Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time?

1017
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:34,640
Dr. Keller,

1018
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,320
stretch Watney's rations four more days.

1019
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,530
You're not gonna like it, but that'll get us to 15.

1020
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:39,620
And we'll cancel the inspections.

1021
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,390
Teddy.

1022
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,680
- Sir, if that ever got out... - It's on me.

1023
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:44,140
You got your two weeks.

1024
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,230
Get it done.

1025
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,300
So, now I have to hold out

1027
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,720
until the probe gets here with more food.

1028
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,390
You want to see what minimal calorie count looks like?

1029
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,910
Standard issue ration.

1030
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:59,230
But instead of three of these every one day...

1031
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,930
I'm now eating one of these every three days.

1032
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,980
And now, they've asked me...

1033
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,470
to do that.

1035
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,440
The point is...

1037
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:18,490
"Stretch the rations four more days"...

1038
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,630
is a real dick-punch.

1039
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,360
I'm gonna dip this potato in some crushed Vicodin.

1040
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,330
And there's nobody who can stop me.

1042
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,640
It has been seven days since I ran out of ketchup.

1045
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,980
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

1046
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:01,550
Let's go up here.

1047
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,990
Labels facing up.

1049
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,270
This is the flight director.

1050
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,060
Begin launch status check.

1051
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,870
Roger that, flight. Beginning launch status check.

1052
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,340
Do you believe in god, Vincent?

1053
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,120
Yeah.

1054
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,660
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

1055
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,910
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...

1056
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,800
I believe in several.

1057
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,650
We'll take all the help we can get.

1058
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,540
Launch status check complete.

1059
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,850
This is flight.

1060
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,580
We are go for launch.

1061
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,990
Proceeding with the count.

1062
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,820
10... 9...

1063
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:39,760
8...

1064
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,470
7... 6...

1065
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,950
Main engines start.

1066
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,720
4... 3...

1067
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,000
2... Ignition.

1068
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,910
1.

1069
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,290
Liftoff.

1070
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,040
Good thrust.

1071
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,920
Performance is nominal.

1072
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,300
The tail is giving good data.

1073
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,590
She's rock solid at this point, flight.

1074
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,830
TVCs look good.

1075
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,330
We're getting a little shimmy, flight.

1076
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,980
Say again?

1077
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:37,130
We are getting a very large precession.

1078
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,230
Are we good?

1079
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:40,970
Flight, it's hitting the redline.

1080
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,000
It's spinning on the long axis around a 17-degree precession.

1081
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,710
Launch, what's happening?

1082
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,640
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

1083
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,820
We've lost readings on the probe, flight.

1084
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,690
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1085
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,900
We've lost it, flight.

1086
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:06,890
Satcon?

1087
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:09,180
No satellite acquisition of signal.

1088
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:13,280
L.O.S.

1089
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,680
L.O.S. Here, too.

1090
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,370
U.S. Destroyer Stockton

1091
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,300
reporting debris falling from the sky.

1092
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,530
Everyone in the LCC,

1093
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,070
maintain your positions at your consoles.

1094
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,170
GC, lock the doors.

1100
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,510
"Commander Lewis...

1101
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,590
"I may need you to do something for me.

1102
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:04,050
"If I die, I need you to check in on my parents.

1103
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:08,560
"They'll wanna hear all about our time here on Mars.

1104
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,320
"I know that sucks.

1105
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,660
"And it'll be hard talking to a couple...

1106
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,410
"about their dead son.

1107
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,460
"It's a lot to ask.

1108
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,010
"Which is why I'm asking you.

1109
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,950
"I'm not giving up.

1110
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:33,490
"We just need to prepare for every outcome.

1111
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,540
"Please tell them...

1112
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:41,770
"Tell them I love what I do...

1113
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,860
"And I'm really good at it.

1114
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,070
"And that I'm dying...

1115
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,950
"for something big...

1116
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,850
"and beautiful...

1117
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,190
"and greater than me.

1118
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,870
"Tell them I said I can live with that.

1119
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,680
"And tell them...

1120
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:18,480
"Thank you for being my mom and dad."

1122
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,940
We substituted protein cubes

1123
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,580
for the standard rations.

1124
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,050
The thrust of the launch combined

1125
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,550
with the simultaneous lateral vibration...

1126
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:33,310
Liquefied the cubes and created an unbalanced load.

1130
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,900
Vincent, why wasn't this addressed

1131
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,360
in the inspections phase?

1132
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,010
In order to make our launch window,

1133
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,620
we were forced to accelerate our schedule.

1136
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,630
Yes.

1137
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,500
Yes, I understand.

1138
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,910
Thank you.

1139
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:45,810
Yes!

1140
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,210
All right.

1141
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:50,060
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,

1142
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,900
we get another chance at this.

1143
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,160
Now, we finished the Iris probe in 62 days.

1144
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,960
We are now gonna attempt to finish it in 28.

1147
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,630
We can jettison any kind of landing system.

1148
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,710
We're only sending rations.

1149
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:29,000
We can crash-land on Mars.

1150
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,740
You should hang up the phone.

1151
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:32,970
I'm sorry, who are you?

1152
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:33,790
My name is Rich Purnell.

1153
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:34,680
I work in astrodynamics,

1154
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,640
and you should hang up the phone right now.

1155
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:39,860
All right, all right.

1156
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,630
I'm gonna call you back.

1157
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,310
I know how to save Mark Watney.

1158
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:48,400
Your probe plan won't work. Too many things can go wrong.

1159
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,730
I've got a better way.

1160
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,060
Astrodynamics?

1161
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,380
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

1163
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,900
I had to make something up.

1164
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,160
But "Elrond"?

1165
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:00,690
Because it's a secret meeting.

1166
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,790
How do you know that?

1167
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,670
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

1168
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:06,650
The Council of Elrond. It's from Lord of the Rings.

1169
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:07,660
{\an1}Lord of the Rings.

1170
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:09,720
{\an3}It's the meeting where they decide to destroy the one ring.

1171
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,630
If we're gonna call something "Project Elrond"...

1173
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:14,140
I would like my code name to be "Glorfindel."

1174
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,140
Okay, I hate every one of you.

1175
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,630
What, Teddy doesn't even know about this yet?

1176
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:19,280
I'm sorry, who are you?

1177
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,410
This is Rich Purnell, astrodynamics.

1178
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,570
Tell them what you just told me.

1179
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:27,810
I can get the Hermes back to Mars by SOL 561.

1180
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,380
How?

1181
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,610
Could you stand right there for me, please?

1182
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:39,670
Thanks.

1183
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:41,260
Right there. Great.

1184
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,370
And could you stand right there? Right there.

1185
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:53,940
Okay, let's pretend that this stapler is the Hermes...

1186
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,610
And you are...

1187
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,930
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

1188
01:23:58,010 --> 01:24:01,260
Teddy. I'm the director of NASA.

1189
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,670
Cool. Teddy, you're earth.

1190
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,290
And right now, the Hermes is headed towards you...

1191
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,890
Starting its month-long deceleration to intercept.

1192
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,720
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

1193
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,990
We start accelerating immediately

1194
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:19,530
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

1195
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:20,830
We don't intercept with earth at all...

1196
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:22,290
But we come close enough

1197
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,670
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1198
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,270
While we're doing that...

1199
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,440
We resupply with the probe...

1200
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,720
The Taiyang Shen.

1201
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,330
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

1202
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:35,880
And now we're accelerating towards Mars.

1203
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,270
You're Mars.

1204
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:40,460
Now, we're going too fast

1205
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,760
at this point to fall into orbit...

1206
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,270
But we can do a flyby.

1207
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:45,050
What good is a flyby

1208
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:47,240
if we can't get Watney off the surface?

1209
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,860
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

1210
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,990
And then we just head home.

1211
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,770
I've done the math. It checks out.

1212
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,110
- Rich. - Yes, sir.

1213
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,120
Get out.

1214
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,150
All right.

1215
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:17,260
- Is he right? - Yeah.

1216
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,450
Bruce, what do you think?

1217
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,000
Well, if Vincent says so.

1218
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:25,230
We need to use the Taiyang Shen?

1219
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,280
Uh-huh.

1220
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,800
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1221
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,040
Because we can only do one.

1222
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,390
Send Watney enough food to last till Ares 4...

1223
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:34,390
or send Hermes back to get him right now.

1224
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,250
Both plans require the Taiyang Shen,

1225
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,700
so we have to choose.

1226
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,160
But what about the Hermes crew?

1227
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,020
We'd be asking them to add

1228
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:45,080
533 extra days to their mission.

1229
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,260
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate, not for a second.

1230
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,080
Can the Hermes function for 533 days

1231
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,470
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1232
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,500
It should.

1233
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,570
Built to last the full Ares mission...

1234
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:57,350
So technically, it's only halfway through its lifespan.

1235
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,640
But if something goes wrong...

1236
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,990
Then we lose the crew.

1237
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,040
So what? We either have a high chance

1238
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,150
of killing one person...

1239
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,970
Or a low chance of killing six people.

1240
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,360
How do we make that decision?

1241
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,090
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1242
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:11,530
He does.

1243
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,940
Yeah, well, bullshit.

1244
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:14,750
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1245
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:16,360
We still have a chance to bring

1246
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,320
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1247
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,490
I'm not risking their lives.

1248
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,060
Let them make that decision.

1249
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,990
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1250
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,170
You goddamn coward.

1251
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:49,730
Johanssen?

1252
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:52,490
I know it's your private time.

1253
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:53,830
Can I bother you for a second?

1254
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:54,960
Yeah, go ahead.

1255
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:55,960
Where are you?

1256
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,960
The gym.

1257
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,540
What's up?

1258
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,000
I just got an email from my wife

1259
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,680
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1260
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,780
My computer won't open the attachment.

1261
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:28,990
Okay.

1262
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:30,610
Let's take a look.

1263
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,110
Let's see.

1265
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,400
This isn't a jpeg.

1266
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,470
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1267
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,240
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1270
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:53,480
Does that make any sense to you?

1272
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,320
"Rich Purnell maneuver."

1273
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:00,480
It's a course maneuver for the Hermes.

1277
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:07,790
And the mission concludes with earth intercept,

1279
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,610
211 days later.

1280
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:11,520
Would it work?

1281
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,380
Mmm-hmm. We ran the numbers. They check out.

1282
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,760
It's a brilliant course.

1283
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,690
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1284
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,950
Because it goes directly against NASA's decision.

1285
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:22,910
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1286
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,120
they'd have to send the supply ship or we die.

1287
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:27,890
We have the opportunity to force their hand.

1288
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:32,030
So, are we gonna do it?

1289
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,420
If it was up to me, we'd already be on our way.

1290
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,630
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1291
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,190
Not this time.

1292
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,990
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1293
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,880
We're talking about mutiny here,

1294
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,590
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1295
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:49,460
So we do this together or not at all.

1296
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:52,440
And before you answer, consider the consequences.

1297
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,800
If we mess up the supply rendezvous, we die.

1298
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,580
If we mess up the earth gravity assist, we die.

1299
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,960
If we do everything perfectly...

1300
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,260
We add 533 days to our mission.

1301
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:09,270
533 more days before we see our families again.

1302
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,940
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1303
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,630
Where anything could go wrong.

1304
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:19,230
If it's mission critical, we die.

1305
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,730
Sign me up.

1306
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,560
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1307
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,320
You and I, we're military.

1308
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,330
Chances are, we go home, they'll court martial us.

1309
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:27,160
Yeah, there's that.

1310
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,310
And for the rest of you guys...

1311
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:31,600
I guarantee they will never send you back up here again.

1312
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,260
Good. So, if we go for it, how would it work?

1313
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,980
I plot the course and execute it.

1314
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,240
Remote override.

1315
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,620
They could take over the Hermes

1316
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:41,950
from mission control.

1317
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:44,410
Can you disable it?

1318
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:47,270
Hermes has four redundant flight computers...

1319
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:50,020
Each connected to three redundant comm systems.

1320
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,100
We can't shut down the comms

1321
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,720
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1322
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,570
And we can't shut down the computers

1323
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:56,330
because we need to run the ship.

1324
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:59,750
I'd have to disable remote override on each system.

1325
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,910
It's part of the os, I'd have to jump over the code.

1326
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:04,500
Okay, but, like, in English, what would that mean?

1327
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,790
I can do it.

1328
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:09,900
Great.

1329
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:13,370
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1330
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:18,430
If we do this, it'll be over 900 days of space.

1331
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,470
That's more than enough space for one life...

1332
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,220
So, yes.

1333
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:27,790
I vote yes.

1334
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,790
Let's go get him.

1335
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,270
Johanssen?

1336
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,040
Yes.

1337
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:39,360
Yeah!

1338
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,360
Got an unscheduled status update from Hermes.

1339
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,600
Roger. Read it out.

1340
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,890
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

1342
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,250
"Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man."

1343
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:51,310
What?

1344
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:52,810
Flight, guidance.

1345
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:54,690
Hermes is off-course.

1346
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:56,300
Capcom, advise Hermes they're drifting.

1347
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,100
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1348
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:59,960
Negative, flight, it's not drift.

1349
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,200
They've adjusted course.

1350
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,320
What the hell?

1351
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,530
Telemetry, any chance this is instrumentation failure?

1352
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:06,480
Negative, flight.

1353
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,920
Guidance, work at how long they can stay on this course

1354
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,230
before it's irreversible.

1355
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,750
Working on that now, flight.

1356
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,630
Who's Rich Purnell?

1357
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:15,140
I dunno.

1358
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,900
Will somebody find out who the hell Rich Purnell is?

1359
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,450
Annie will go before the media this morning...

1360
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,270
and inform them of NASA's decision

1361
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:24,800
to reroute the Hermes to Mars.

1362
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:27,030
Sounds like a smart move.

1363
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:29,990
Considering the circumstances.

1364
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:35,380
Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information.

1365
01:31:35,810 --> 01:31:37,440
Crew made the decision on their own.

1366
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:41,450
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1367
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,100
We're fighting the same war.

1368
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:46,600
Every time something goes wrong,

1369
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,520
the world forgets why we fly.

1370
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,400
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1371
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,460
It's bigger than one person.

1372
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,160
No.

1373
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:56,820
It's not.

1374
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,560
When this is over, I'll expect your resignation.

1375
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:06,320
I understand.

1376
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,450
Bring our astronauts home.

1378
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:15,050
Every Ares Mission requires three years of pre-supplies.

1379
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:17,380
So NASA decided a long time ago it's a lot easier

1380
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,440
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1381
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,560
rather than bring it with us.

1382
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,280
So, as a result, the mav for Ares 4

1383
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,680
is already there at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1384
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:31,570
So the plan is for me to use that to go into orbit...

1385
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:34,730
just as the Hermes is passing...

1386
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:37,750
and I guess they catch me?

1387
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:40,140
In space.

1388
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,180
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out

1389
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:49,110
how to take everything here that's keeping me alive...

1390
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:52,870
The oxygenator, the water reclaimer, the atmospheric regulator...

1391
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,480
bring that all with me.

1392
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,690
And luckily, I have the greatest minds on planet Earth...

1393
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:01,930
Really, all of the brainpower on the entire planet...

1394
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:03,860
helping me with this endeavor.

1395
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,590
And so far they've come up with...

1396
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,210
"Hey, why don't you drill holes on the roof of your rover...

1397
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,580
"and hit it as hard as you can with a rock?"

1398
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:12,570

1461
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:17,500
I've been thinking about laws on Mars.

1462
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,960
There's an international treaty saying

1463
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,900
no country can lay claim to anything that's not on Earth.

1464
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,200
And by another treaty,

1465
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,200
if you're not in any country's territory...

1466
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,020
maritime law applies.

1467
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:30,090
So Mars is international waters.

1468
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:33,870
Now, NASA is an American non-military organization.

1469
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,160
It owns the hab.

1470
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:38,250
But the second I walk outside, I'm in international waters.

1471
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,680
So here's the cool part.

1472
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:41,310
I'm about to leave for the Schiaparelli Crater

1473
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,510
where I'm gonna commandeer the Ares 4 lander.

1474
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:45,710
Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this

1475
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:48,570
and they can't until I'm on board the Ares 4.

1476
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:51,340
So that means I'm gonna be taking a craft over

1477
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,890
in international waters without permission.

1479
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:57,730
Which, by definition, makes me a pirate.

1480
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:02,000
Mark Watney, space pirate.

1482
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,400
A space pirate.

1483
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,810
Everywhere I go, I'm the first.

1484
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:40,490
It's a strange feeling.

1485
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,950
Step outside the rover...

1486
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:44,320
first guy to be there.

1487
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:48,010
Climb that hill, first guy to do that.

1488
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,730
Four and a half billion years...

1489
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,130
nobody here.

1490
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:56,360
And now, me.

1491
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,110
I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet.

1492
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:17,680
How's he doing?

1493
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:20,800
So far, so good.

1494
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,760
He's sticking to schedule.

1495
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,670
Drives for four hours before noon...

1496
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:28,120
lays the solar panels,

1497
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,100
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...

1498
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:34,470
and sleeps somewhere in there and then starts again.

1499
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,810
How's he doing?

1500
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:42,420
He asked us to call him Captain Blondebeard.

1501
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,480
Well, technically, Mars would be under maritime...

1502
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,370
Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.

1503
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,480
Where is he?

1504
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:53,930
- There. - Okay.

1505
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,420
Here.

1506
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:56,950
Okay.

1509
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:43,730
Okay, I'm gonna start by stating for the record

1510
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:45,210
that you're not gonna like this.

1511
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:46,260
Oh, yeah?

1512
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:49,610
Yeah, the problem is the intercept velocity.

1513
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:54,500
The Hermes, well... It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1514
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:58,060
Otherwise, they'll never have enough fuel to make it home.

1515
01:43:58,060 --> 01:44:02,480
The MAV, that was only designed to get to low Mars orbit.

1516
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:06,910
So in order for Mark to escape Mars' gravity entirely...

1517
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:08,160
and to intercept the Hermes...

1518
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,140
- He has to be going fast. - Exactly.

1519
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,700
Which means we need to make the mav lighter.

1520
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,530
A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.

1521
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:16,560
You can do that, right?

1522
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,350
There's some gimmes right off the bat.

1523
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:22,230
The design presumes 500 kilograms of martian soil and samples.

1524
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,840
Obviously we won't do that.

1525
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,510
And there's just one passenger instead of six.

1526
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:30,340
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

1527
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:32,410
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

1528
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,380
And we'll get Mark to wear his Eva suit the whole trip.

1529
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,970
Wait a second. If he's in his Eva suit,

1530
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:37,570
how is he gonna operate the controls?

1531
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:39,900
Well, he won't.

1532
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:44,020
Martinez will pilot the mav remotely from the Hermes.

1533
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:46,840
We've never had a manned ship controlled remotely before.

1534
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:52,540
But I am excited about the opportunities that affords.

1535
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:55,140
If we go remote, we can lose the control panels,

1536
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:57,250
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

1537
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:58,130
Wait-wait a second.

1538
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:02,620
You want a remote-controlled ascent with no backup comms?

1539
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,550
He's not even got to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1540
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,510
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

1541
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,550
We need to remove the nose airlock,

1542
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:13,420
the windows, and hull panel 19.

1543
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,560
You want to take the front of the ship off?

1544
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,470
Sure.

1545
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:20,630
The nose airlock alone is 400 kilograms.

1546
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:22,050
You want to send a man into space

1547
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:22,740
without the front of his ship?

1548
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:23,870
Well, no.

1549
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:28,830
We're gonna have him cover it with hab canvas.

1550
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:32,950
Look, the hull's mostly there to keep the air in.

1551
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:35,030
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

1552
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:36,380
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1553
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,070
By the time the ship's going fast enough

1554
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,000
for air resistance to matter...

1555
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,390
It'll be high enough that there's practically no air.

1556
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:45,270
You wanna send him into space under a tarp.

1557
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,130
Yes.

1558
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,460
Can I go on?

1559
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,090
No.

1561
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:58,040
You think he means it like...

1562
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:00,720
"Are you kidding me?"

1563
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,410
You know?

1564
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:05,420
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1565
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,470
I think it might be the second one.

1566
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:09,520
Really?

1567
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,660
Could be the first way.

1569
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:13,730
"Are you kidding me?"

1570
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,130
Yeah, it could be the first way.

1573
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,920
I know what they're doing.

1574
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,640
I know exactly what they're doing.

1575
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:48,300
They just keep repeating...

1576
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,390
"Go faster than any man in the history of space travel."

1578
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:52,770
Like that's a good thing.

1579
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,590
Like it'll distract me from how insane their plan is.

1580
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:57,970
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man

1581
01:46:57,970 --> 01:47:00,250
in the history of space travel...

1582
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,370
Because you are launching me in a convertible.

1583
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:04,670
Actually it's worse than that

1584
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:07,140
because I won't even be able to control the thing.

1586
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:09,860
And by the way, physicists,

1587
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:12,680
when describing things like acceleration...

1588
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:14,580
do not use the word "fast."

1589
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,710
So they're only doing that in the hopes

1590
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:19,760
that I won't raise any objections...

1591
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,620
To this lunacy.

1593
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:25,640
Because I like the way

1594
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:28,230
"fastest man in the history of space travel" sounds.

1595
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:32,010
I do like the way it sounds.

1596
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:34,910
I mean, I like it a lot.

1597
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,260
I'm not gonna tell them that.

1598
01:47:46,010 --> 01:47:46,940
Okay.

1599
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,670
Let's do this.

1600
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:26,960
Come on.

1603
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,010
Beck, Vogel, I want you guys in Airlock 2

1604
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:24,960
with the outer door open...

1606
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,810
- before the mav even launches. - Okay.

1607
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:30,920
Martinez flies the mav, Johanssen sysops the ascent.

1608
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:32,930
Once we hit intercept,

1609
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:34,730
it's Beck's job to go get Watney.

1610
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:35,910
We're ready.

1611
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,460
What's the intercept plan?

1612
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,620
We finished attaching the tethers into one long line.

1613
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:42,750
It's 214 meters long.

1614
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:43,700
And I'll have the MMU,

1615
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:45,510
so moving around should be easy.

1616
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:48,280
How fast a relative velocity can you handle?

1617
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:51,320
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

1618
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:53,130
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.

1619
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:55,540
So any more than that and I might miss.

1620
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:57,590
Well, we may have some leeway.

1621
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,900
The launch takes 12 minutes.

1622
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:03,820
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1623
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:05,710
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1624
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:09,060
we'll know our intercept point and velocity.

1625
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:11,060
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1626
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,880
Everything goes well, you pull them on board with the tether.

1627
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,740
If anything goes wrong, you go out after him.

1628
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,620
Yep.

1629
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:19,090
Okay.

1630
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:22,540
Let's go get our boy.

1633
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,080
There's a mood of tension and anxiety here,

1634
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,440
outside Johnson Space Center.

1635
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,220
As you can see,

1636
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:31,110
many people have gathered here...

1637
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:32,160
to see whether or not

1638
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:35,760
the mission to retrieve Mark Watney will be a success.

1639
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,530
They've had some contact with him,

1641
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:39,770
but it hasn't been very much.

1642
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,320
We have to remind our viewers

1643
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,430
that we're watching this as it unfolds.

1644
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,490
So we'll try and keep you up-to-date

1645
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:47,190
as to what exactly is going on.

1646
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:51,260
Let's listen in to NASA making contact with Mark Watney.

1648
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:52,220
Let's listen in.

1649
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,960
If something goes wrong, what can mission control do?

1650
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,290
Not a damn thing.

1651
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:06,420
It's all happening 12 light-minutes away...

1652
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:08,190
Which means it takes 24 minutes for them

1653
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:10,760
to get the answer to any question they ask.

1654
01:53:11,380 --> 01:53:13,690
The whole launch is 12 minutes, so...

1655
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,300
They're on their own.

1657
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,270
...just how long Mark has been

1659
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:23,970
completely alone on Mars.

1660
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:27,880
We're talking to a psychology expert later to discuss...

1661
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:51,940
Fuel pressure, green.

1662
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,390
Engine alignment, perfect.

1663
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:56,450
Communications, five by five.

1664
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,640
We are ready for pre-flight checklist, commander.

1665
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,030
Mission control, this is Hermes actual.

1666
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:04,970
We will proceed on schedule.

1667
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:08,810
We are t-minus 2 minutes 10 seconds to launch, by the mark.

1668
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:10,900
About two minutes, Watney.

1669
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,210
How you doing down there?

1670
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:13,190
I'm good.

1671
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,680
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1672
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,140
Thanks for coming back for me.

1673
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:19,200
Well, we're on it.

1674
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:20,840
Remember, you'll be pulling some serious G's,

1675
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,800
so it's okay to pass out.

1676
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,680
You're in Martinez's hands now.

1677
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,670
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

1678
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,320
Copy that, MAV.

1679
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:31,740
Capcom.

1680
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:32,930
Go.

1681
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:34,150
Remote command.

1682
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:34,980
Go.

1683
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,010
Recovery.

1684
01:55:36,270 --> 01:55:37,140
Go.

1685
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:38,790
Secondary recovery.

1686
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,740
Go.

1687
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:40,970
Pilot.

1688
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:43,340
Go.

1689
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,350
Pilot.

1690
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:45,660
Go.

1691
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,130
Copy. We're go.

1692
01:55:48,190 --> 01:55:51,040
Mission control, we are go for launch.

1693
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:53,110
T-minus 10...

1694
01:55:53,110 --> 01:55:53,610
9...

1695
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:55,060
Main engine start.

1696
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,120
8...

1697
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,680
7...

1698
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,410
Mooring clamps released.

1699
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:01,230
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1700
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,130
I'll see you in a few, commander.

1701
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:04,080
4...

1702
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:05,780
3...

1703
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,470
2...

1704
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:09,100
1.

1705
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,880
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1706
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,880
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1707
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:50,660
That's too low.

1708
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:52,090
It's fighting me.

1709
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:59,640
Watney, do you read?

1710
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:07,110
Booster separation complete.

1711
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:09,820
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1712
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,470
He's well below target altitude.

1713
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:12,820
How far below?

1714
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:14,290
Checking.

1715
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:16,020
Watney.

1716
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:18,060
Do you read?

1717
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:19,520
He's probably passed out.

1718
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:20,930
He pulled 12 G's on the ascent.

1719
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:22,150
Give him a few minutes.

1720
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:23,060
Copy that.

1721
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:27,450
Main shutdown in 3...

1722
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,600
2, 1...

1723
01:57:30,070 --> 01:57:31,010
Shutdown.

1724
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,760
Back to automatic guidance.

1725
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,080
Shutdown confirmed.

1726
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:40,560
Fuel reserves depleted.

1727
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:43,550
Watney?

1728
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,340
Do you read?

1729
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:49,210
It seems there's some sort of problem with the transmission.

1730
01:57:56,330 --> 01:57:57,760
I have interval pings.

1731
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,460
Intercept velocity will be 11 meters per second.

1732
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:01,750
I can make that work.

1733
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,530
Distance at intercept will be...

1734
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:07,510
we'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1735
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:09,260
68 kilometers?

1736
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:11,750
Did she just say 68 kilometers?

1737
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:13,890
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1738
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:15,230
Work the problem.

1739
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,610
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1740
01:58:18,010 --> 01:58:20,600
39 minutes, 12 seconds.

1741
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,510
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1742
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:23,770
in the same direction?

1743
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:26,250
Well, it depends how much fuel you wanna save...

1744
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:28,420
for the altitude adjustments for the trip home.

1745
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:29,570
How much do you need?

1746
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:34,560
I can get by with about 20% of what we have left.

1747
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,370
If we use 75.5% of remaining altitude-adjust fuel...

1748
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:40,830
That will bring the intercept range to zero.

1749
01:58:40,830 --> 01:58:41,730
Do it.

1750
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,980
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1751
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:48,420
but the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second.

1752
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,800
And that's way too fast.

1753
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,640
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1754
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,800
how to slow down.

1755
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,920
Martinez, burn the jets.

1756
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,100
Copy that.

1757
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:24,550
MAV to Hermes.

1758
01:59:25,190 --> 01:59:26,130
Watney?

1759
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:27,370
Affirmative.

1760
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:33,250
What's your status?

1761
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,720
My chest hurts.

1762
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:36,660
I broke my ribs.

1763
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:38,410
How are you?

1764
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,550
We're working on getting to you.

1765
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:41,460
There was a complication during launch.

1766
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:42,430
Copy that.

1767
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:44,580
How bad is it?

1768
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,510
We've corrected the intercept range,

1769
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:48,780
but we've got a problem with intercept velocity.

1770
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:50,140
How big a problem?

1771
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:51,680
42 meters a second.

1772
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,110
Well...

1773
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:55,490
Shit.

1774
02:00:00,810 --> 02:00:02,820
Commander, I have an idea.

1775
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:03,930
Go ahead, Mark.

1776
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:07,570
Well, if I can find something sharp in here...

1777
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:10,540
and poke a hole in the glove of my Eva suit...

1778
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:13,150
I could use the escaping air as a thruster...

1779
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:14,770
and fly towards you.

1780
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:17,910
It would be easy to control because it would be on my arm.

1781
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:20,190
I can't see you having any control if you did that.

1782
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:22,050
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1783
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:24,470
using a thrust vector you can barely control.

1784
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:28,430
Yes, those are all very good points.

1785
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:31,050
But consider this.

1786
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:35,680
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

1787
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:38,440
Commander...

1788
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:40,440
Let's go Iron Man.

1789
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,370
This is unexpected los.

1790
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,240
Communication lost. Stand by.

1791
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:50,430
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1792
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:52,980
No, it is the worst idea. It's the worst idea ever.

1793
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,330
Not what he said.

1794
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:56,760
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1795
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,680
What happens if we blow the val?

1796
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:02,790
Wait, you want to open the vehicular airlock?

1797
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,860
It'll give us a good kick.

1798
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:05,500
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1799
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,760
And all the air would leave and we need air to not die.

1800
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:11,280
We would seal the bridge and the reactor room.

1801
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,850
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1802
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,530
Vogel.

1803
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:15,950
Go ahead, Commander.

1804
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,680
I need you to come inside and make a... bomb.

1805
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:20,340
Again, Commander?

1806
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:21,530
You're a chemist.

1807
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:23,810
Can you make a bomb with what you have on board?

1808
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:26,040
Probably.

1809
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,590
But I feel obliged to mention

1810
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,670
that setting off an explosive device...

1811
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:33,750
in a spacecraft is a terrible, terrible idea.

1812
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:36,460
Hang on. You guys making a bomb without me?

1813
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,170
Copy that. Can you do it?

1814
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:42,310
Ja.

1815
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:46,140
Houston, be advised.

1816
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:48,440
We are going to deliberately breach the val

1817
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:50,540
to produce a reverse thrust.

1818
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:52,230
Beck, leave your suit on.

1819
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:53,740
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1820
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:54,840
We'll open the outer door.

1821
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:57,270
I need you to place the charge on the inner door.

1822
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:59,410
Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.

1823
02:01:59,410 --> 02:02:01,370
Copy. I'm on my way.

1824
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,270
I'm in, Commander.

1825
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:11,250
Copy that.

1826
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:22,220
Vogel, where are you?

1827
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:23,390
I'm in the kitchen.

1828
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:24,440
Okay.

1829
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,510
Commander...

1830
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:31,600
I can't let you go through with this.

1831
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,440
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1832
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,580
Absolutely not.

1833
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:37,400
See, the thing is, I'm selfish.

1834
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,450
I want all the memorials back home to be about me.

1835
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:41,340
Just me.

1836
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,360
I should have left this guy on Mars.

1837
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:48,810
Sugar?

1838
02:02:48,810 --> 02:02:49,680
Yeah.

1839
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,210
Can you hold this?

1840
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:57,450
Liquid oxygen...

1841
02:02:58,090 --> 02:03:01,500
and some stain remover that contains ammonia.

1842
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:08,070
This thing here is five times stronger

1843
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:10,010
than a stick of dynamite.

1844
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,240
How do we activate it?

1845
02:03:11,290 --> 02:03:13,600
Can you connect this to one of our lighting panels?

1846
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:19,000
Careful.

1847
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,870
Open Airlock 1.

1848
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,170
I'm on the way to Beck.

1849
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:40,350
Let's just hope this is a good idea, guys.

1850
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,330
It is.

1851
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:42,300
Open A1.

1852
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:49,090
- Hi. - Hey.

1853
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:53,710
You got it?

1854
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:02,270
Make sure you're not in here when this thing goes off.

1855
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,160
Hey.

1856
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:07,070
Be careful out there.

1857
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:08,440
In space.

1858
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,230
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1859
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:26,110
Bomb set.

1860
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:37,070
Leaving Airlock 1.

1861
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:43,040
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

1862
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,060
and even with optimal val blow...

1863
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:46,770
we're gonna be off on our angle.

1864
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:49,490
What's the intercept distance? Johanssen?

1865
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:52,010
260 meters, approximate.

1866
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:53,140
That's too far.

1867
02:05:02,490 --> 02:05:03,450
Commander?

1868
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:05,510
Martinez, close the door.

1869
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:09,880
Open D3.

1870
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,300
And leave it open.

1871
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:42,870
Open B2.

1872
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,660
Johanssen...

1873
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:51,340
Time to val blow after initiate?

1874
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:52,470
15 seconds.

1875
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:55,460
We sure know how to cut it close.

1876
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:56,850
Commander?

1877
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:59,390
Distance is too far. I'm going out.

1878
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:00,490
I can do this.

1879
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:01,660
It's not a debate.

1880
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:03,470
I'm not risking another crew member.

1881
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,040
Beck's returned.

1882
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:07,090
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1883
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,850
Ten seconds.

1884
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:09,810
Strap in.

1885
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:12,930
5, 4...

1886
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:14,250
3...

1887
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:16,270
- Brace for deceleration. - 2...

1888
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,700
1.

1889
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,480
Activating Panel 41.

1890
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:42,610
Bridge seal holding.

1891
02:06:42,610 --> 02:06:43,510
What's the damage?

1892
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:44,880
Worry about that later.

1893
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:46,520
What's the relative velocity?

1894
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:48,100
12 meters per second.

1895
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:49,130
Copy.

1896
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:53,150
Hook me up.

1897
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:55,500
Done.

1898
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,320
I have visual on the MAV.

1899
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,540
What's the intercept range?

1900
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,750
I'm checking.

1901
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:14,410
312 meters.

1902
02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:17,120
Did you say 312?

1903
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:19,290
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

1904
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:30,640
I can't get to you, Mark. You're too far.

1905
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:32,160
I'm not gonna make it.

1906
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:33,040
I know.

1907
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:35,000
Beck, unhook me. I'm going after him.

1908
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:37,200
Commander, I got this.

1909
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:52,670
Mark, report.

1910
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:54,820
On my way, Commander.

1911
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,380
Damn it.

1912
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,730
Johanssen, what's my relative velocity to Mark?

1913
02:08:08,730 --> 02:08:10,610
5.2 meters per second.

1914
02:08:10,610 --> 02:08:12,480
Copy. Adjusting course.

1915
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,910
3.1 meters per second.

1916
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:24,590
Distance to target, 24 meters.

1917
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:28,310
11 meters to target.

1918
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:32,270
Six meters.

1919
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:44,560
Hold on, Mark.

1920
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:13,910
I got him.

1921
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:17,710
I got him.

1922
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:20,170
I got him.

1923
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:21,450
Way to go, Iron Man.

1924
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:26,400
Beck, pull us in.

1925
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:30,510
It's good to see you.

1926
02:09:32,650 --> 02:09:33,590
You...

1927
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:39,090
have terrible taste in music.

1928
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,550
Houston, this is Hermes actual.

1929
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:51,910
We got him.

1930
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:54,870
Watney is secure.

1931
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,780
Contact in outer space with Mark Watney.

1932
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:04,990
After a very long time, they have done

1933
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:07,010
what many people thought was impossible.

1934
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:08,080
Mission confirmation:

1935
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:11,320
Mark Watney has been successfully rescued.

1936
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:15,930
Grab a hold of him.

1937
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:19,510
Hey, handsome!

1938
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:21,130
Beck, close the hatch.

1939
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:25,640
Hey, guys!

1940
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:33,270
Houston, six crew safely aboard.

1941
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:40,220
This is huge moment for this nation, for the world...

1942
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:43,630
and indeed, for international space travel.

1943
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,850
I can't believe anything you do works.

1944
02:10:46,710 --> 02:10:47,800
Hey!

1945
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:51,000
Oh, god.

1946
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,370
I can't believe it.

1947
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:55,220
There's a little smell going on over there, bud.

1948
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:58,300
I know. I haven't had a shower in a year and a half.

1949
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,600
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

1950
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:36,630
Hey, there.

1951
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:47,570
- Morning, sir. - It's an honor, sir.

1952
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:48,470
Sir.

1953
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:50,790
- Sir. - Sir.

1954
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:52,090
Morning, sir.

1955
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:16,840
Welcome to the astronaut candidate program.

1956
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:18,270
Now pay attention,

1957
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,460
because this could save your life.

1958
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:22,860
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

1959
02:12:23,850 --> 02:12:26,150
Let me get a few things out of the way, right off the bat.

1960
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:29,840
Yes, I did in fact survive on a deserted planet

1961
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,020
by farming in my own shit.

1962
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:35,540
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.

1963
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,590
So let's not talk about that ever again.

1964
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:41,890
The other question I get most frequently is...

1965
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:44,580
"When I was up there, stranded by myself...

1966
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:46,210
"Did I think I was going to die?"

1967
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:49,150
Yes, absolutely.

1968
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,530
And that's what you need to know going in

1969
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:53,080
because it's going to happen to you.

1970
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:57,230
This is space. It does not cooperate.

1971
02:12:57,230 --> 02:13:00,150
At some point, everything is going to go south on you.

1972
02:13:00,150 --> 02:13:01,220
Everything is going to go south

1973
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,260
and you're going to say, "This is it.

1974
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:04,440
This is how I end."

1975
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:08,330
Now, you can either accept that...

1976
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:09,560
or you can get to work.

1977
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:12,420
That's all it is.

1978
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:14,950
You just begin.

1979
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:18,540
You do the math. You solve one problem...

1980
02:13:19,150 --> 02:13:20,630
then you solve the next one.

1981
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:21,750
And then the next.

1982
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:22,930
And if you solve enough problems,

1983
02:13:22,930 --> 02:13:24,120
you get to come home.

1984
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:27,680
All right, questions?

1985
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:35,330
Once mission control completes their pre-flight checks...

1986
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:37,540
We'll begin launch procedures.

1987
02:13:37,540 --> 02:13:40,160
The Ares 5 team will rendezvous with the Hermes...

1988
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:43,440
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1989
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,540
From there, they will have 414 days

1990
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:47,250
of space travel ahead of them.

1991
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:48,320
Have the goals changed

1992
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:49,510
from the previous mission...

1993
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:51,300
to the Ares 5 program?

1994
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:53,540
And what do you hope to achieve this time around?

1995
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:55,660
Well, no. The goals have always been the same

1996
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:56,960
for the Ares program.

1997
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,080
This time, of course, we hope to bring

1998
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,170
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1999
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,510
Flight, guidance check complete.

2000
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,760
Copy, guidance.

2001
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:06,570
This is flight.

2002
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:09,380
We are go for launch, on schedule.

2003
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,460
Final aerosurface

2004
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:22,010
checks are complete...

2005
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:25,700
As everything remains a go for the launch of the Ares 5.

2006
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:26,880
20 seconds.

2007
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,740
Proceeding with the count.

2008
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:32,900
T-minus 10...9...

2009
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:34,200
Main engine start.

2010
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:38,140
7...6...5...4...

2011
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:41,490
3...2...1.

2012
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:45,070
And liftoff. As the crew of the Ares 5...

2013
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:49,450
begin the next chapter of American space exploration.

2014
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:50,790
Pressures look good.

2015
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:10,920
Wow. Good shot.

2016
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:14,900
Five years after the rescue of astronaut Mark Watney...

2017
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:17,900
an Ares 5 is on its way to Mars.
